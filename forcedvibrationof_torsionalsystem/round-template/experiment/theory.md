## Introduction<br>
When an applied force causes the system to vibrate it is considered as a case of forced vibration. The external force applied on the system can be of one of the following types.<br>
#### External Harmonic Force<br>

#### Base Excitation<br>

#### Rotating Imbalance<br>

#### Torsional Systems<br>
Torsional vibration is the oscillatory twisting of the shafts in a rotor assembly that is superimposed to the running speed. The frequency can be externally forced or can be an eigenvalue (natural frequency of the torsional system). Resonance will occur if a forcing frequency coincides with a natural frequency.<br>

For a torsional system undergoing vibrations the governing differential equation is-<br>
Jθ’’+cθ’+kθ= F<sub>o</sub>sin(wt)<br>
where F<sub>o</sub>sin(wt) is the external excitation.

The resistance of a cylindrical object to torsional deformation when torque is applied in a plane parallel to the cross-section area or perpendicular to the object's central axis is referred to as the polar moment of inertia. It is given by<br>
