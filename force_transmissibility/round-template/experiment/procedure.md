##### These procedure steps will be followed on the simulator<br>

1.Set a value of Stiffness and Mass for the system. Set a small value of damping ratio (less than half of 0.707). Notice the natural frequency of the system shown below. Set a value of rotating speed in rpm which is not very close to natural frequency. You can also set a value for unbalance which is unbalanced mass times eccentricity.<br>

2.Click on the play icon to start the simulation.You can notice the applied force vs time and transmitted force vs time graphs<br>

3.Click on the graph icon to load the graph of transmissibility and phase angle versus frequency ratio.<br>

4.Click on the left arrow to come back to the system display screen. Increase the value of damping and observe the change in transmissibility.<br>
