##### These procedure steps will be followed on the simulator<br>

1.Set a value of Stiffness and Mass for the system. Set a small value of damping ratio (less than half of 0.707). Notice the natural frequency of the system shown below the graphs. You can change the value of unbalance mass and rotating frequency as well.<br>
